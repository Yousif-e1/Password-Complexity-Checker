# Password-Complexity-Checker
- This program is a Password Complexity Checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on specific criteria, including:

# How it Work
1) Password Input:
- The program prompts the user to enter a password using the input() function.
- The entered password is passed to the assess_password_strength() function for evaluation.

2) Password Evaluation:
- The program checks the password against five criteria:
- Length: At least 8 characters.
- Uppercase Letters: Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Lowercase Letters: Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
- Numbers: Must contain at least one numeric digit.
- Special Characters: Must contain at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %).

3) Feedback Generation:
- For each criterion, the program appends appropriate feedback to a list (feed).
- If the password meets the criterion, it appends a positive message (e.g., "Contains numbers").
- Otherwise, it appends constructive feedback (e.g., "Password should contain at least one number.").

4) Password Strength Assessment:
- The program counts how many criteria the password fails to meet using the phrase "should" in the feedback messages.
- Based on the number of failed criteria:
- 0 Failures: Password is Strong.
- 1â€“2 Failures: Password is Moderate.
- 3 or More Failures: Password is Weak.

5) Final Output:
- The program appends the overall password strength to the feedback list.
- It prints all feedback messages, including both the individual evaluations and the overall strength assessment.
